# Light_WaveTransmission1D_dispersion

This program is computing the reflection, transmission and absorption of a multi layer structure using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). The dispersion of the refractive index is taken into account. A small database of various material is provided. The code allows to get the field distribution inside the structure.

Four structures are proposed:

-> Bragg mirror

-> Fabry-Perot cavity

-> VCSEL structure

-> Polariton structure

=> If you like it, don't forget the star!
